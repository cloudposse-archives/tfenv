# tfenv [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/tfenv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/tfenv) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/tfenv.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/tfenv/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Command line utility to transform environment variables for use with Terraform.
(e.g. `HOSTNAME` → `TF_VAR_hostname`)

It can also intelligently map environment variables to terraform command line arguments (e.g. `TF_CLI_INIT_BACKEND_CONFIG_BUCKET=example` → `TF_CLI_ARGS_init=-backend-config=bucket=example`).

__NOTE__: `tfenv` is **not** a [terraform version manager](#history). It strictly manages environment variables much like `env` or `direnv`.

## Introduction


If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, then look no further!

* Have you ever wished you could easily pass environment variables to terraform *without* adding the `TF_VAR_` prefix?
* Do you use [`chamber`](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber) and get annoyed when it transforms environment variables to uppercase?
* Would you like to use common environment variables names with terraform? (e.g. `USER` or `AWS_REGION`)
* Is there some argument to `terraform init` you want to specify with an environment variable? (e.g. a `-backend-config` property)

**Yes?** Great! Then this utility is for you.

The `tfenv` utility will perform the following transformations:

  1. Lowercase all envs (Terraform convention)
  2. Strip leading or trailing underscores (`_`)
  3. Replace consequtive underscores with a single underscore (`_`)
  4. Prepend prefix (`TF_VAR_`)

__NOTE__: `tfenv` will preserve the existing environment and add the new environment variables with `TF_VAR_`. This is because some terraform providers expect non-`TF_VAR_*` prefixed environment variables. Additionally, when using the `local-exec` provisioner, it's convenient to use regular environment variables. See our [`terraform-null-smtp-mail`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-smtp-mail) module for an example of using this pattern.


**But wait, there's more!**

With `tfenv` we can surgically assign a value to any terraform argument using per-argument environment variables.

## History


**Why is this project called `tfenv`?**

This `tfenv` project borrows it's naming convention from popular tools like [`env`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env), [`direnv`](http://direnv.net), and [`autoenv`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv). These tools provide various ways to export variables in the environment. 

The `env` command has been [around since the early 90s](http://pdplab.it.uom.gr/project/sysadm/unix.pdf), while [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) were first conceived of in 1979. On the other hand there are tools like `rbenv` Et al., which are ["version managers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Version_Manager) that were conceived of sometime around 2010.

## Usage


__NOTE__: The utility supports a number of configuration settings which can be passed via environment variables.

  * `TFENV_PREFIX` - Prefix used for all normalized environment variables (default is `TF_VAR_`, but you could do something like `TF_VAR_app_`)
  * `TFENV_WHITELIST` - Whitelist of allowed environment variables. Processed *after* blacklist. Regular expression should match wanted environment variables (by default `.*`)
  * `TFENV_BLACKLIST` - Blacklist of excluded environment variables. Processed *before* whitelist. Regular expression should exclude unwanted/dangerous environment variables (e.g. AWS credentials)

The basic usage looks like this. We're going to run some `command` and pass it `arg1` ... `argN`:

```sh
tfenv command arg1 arg2 arg3 ... argN
```

So for example, we can pass our current environment to terraform by simply running:

```sh
tfenv terraform plan
```

### Direnv

You can use `tfenv` with [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) very easily. Running `tfenv` without any arguments will emit `export` statements.

Example `.envrc`:

```sh
# Export terraform environment
source <(tfenv)
```

or...
```sh
# Export terraform environment
eval "$(tfenv)"
```

### Bash

Load the terraform environment into your shell.

Just add the following into your shell script:

```sh
source <(tfenv)
```

### Terraform Args

With `tfenv` we can populate the [`TF_CLI_ARGS` and `TF_CLI_ARGS_*` environment variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/environment-variables.html#tf_cli_args-and-tf_cli_args_name) automatically. This makes it easy to toggle settings. 

For example, if you want to pass `-backend-config=bucket=terraform-state-bucket` to `terraform init`, then you would do the following:

```sh
export TF_CLI_INIT_BACKEND_CONFIG_BUCKET=terraform-state-bucket
```

Running `tfenv` will populate the `TF_CLI_ARGS_init=-backend-config=bucket=terraform-state-bucket`

Multiple arguments can be specified and they will be properly concatenated.

### Initializing Modules

Terraform has the built-in capability to initialize "root modules" from a remote sources by passing the `-from-module` argument to `terraform init`.

We can turn this into a 12-factor style invocation using `tfenv`.

```sh
export TF_CLI_INIT_FROM_MODULE=git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-root-modules.git//aws/tfstate-backend?ref=tags/x.y.z
source <(tfenv)
terraform init
```

Learn more about `TF_CLI_ARGS` and `TF_CLI_ARGS_*` in the [official documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/environment-variables.html#tf_cli_args-and-tf_cli_args_name).




## Examples


### Compiling the Binary

```sh
make go/build
```

### Use with Chamber

```sh
chamber exec foobar -- tfenv terraform plan
```

### Use with Terragrunt

```sh
tfenv terragrunt plan
```

### Print Environment

```sh
tfenv printenv
```

### Use with Direnv

You can easily integrate `tfenv` with [`direnv`](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) so that your environment is automatically setup for Terraform.

Add the following to your `.envrc`:

```sh
source <(tfenv)
```
